# NLP Disaster Tweets Kaggle Mini-Project
#### Introduction to Deep Learning, University of Colorado, Boulder

The goal of this Kaggle mini-project is to classify whether a given tweet refers to a natural disaster or not.  Words can be use in a variety of ways.  While in some cases it may be optimal to attempt to classify an article or text based on the presence and frequency of words, in many other situations it is necessary to recognize the manner in which a word is being employed.  The sequence of words is important.  As tweets have historically been limited to only 140 characters, an effective machine learning model will need to derive as much meaning as possible from those characters.  Therefore, for this project I will test a number of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures to solve the task.  In particular I will employ SimpleRNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), as RNNs learn based on the ordering of elements (words) in a given series.

The data and guidelines for this task are available on Kaggle, at the following link location:
